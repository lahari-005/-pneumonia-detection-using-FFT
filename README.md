# 🩻 X-ray Image Classification using FFT and Machine Learning

This project presents a lightweight and interpretable pipeline for classifying X-ray images, particularly targeting pneumonia detection. The system leverages **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to extract meaningful frequency-domain features and combines them with classical **Machine Learning classifiers** such as **SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting**.

## 📌 Features

- Frequency-domain feature extraction using 2D FFT
- Image preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, resizing, and histogram equalization
- Feature engineering: Energy, entropy, and dominant frequency calculation
- Classification using SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
- Visualization of frequency domain patterns



## 🗂️ Dataset

This project uses chest X-ray datasets commonly used for pneumonia detection.
